# Summary of how GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are processed

GitHub is the main tool used by maintainers to manage the PrestaShop project.

This page quickly describes how [Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are processed on GitHub.

## The teams

On GitHub, there are mainly three teams working together on the project.

- Core Product Team: this team takes care of the product vision of the software. It has Product Managers, UX Designers, and a Product Content Manager (employees of the PrestaShop Company)
- Quality Assurance (QA) team: this team takes care of ensuring the quality of the software. It has QA analysts, QA automation engineers and issues managers in charge of reproducing and qualifying issues (employees of the PrestaShop company).
- Core Maintainers Team: this team takes care of the code and act as maintainer for the project (most are employees of the PrestaShop Company, but not all of them)

A maintainer will naturally belong to the Developers team but can also assist and work with the Product Team and QA Team.

## Issues

Currently, there are 4 different types of Issues submitted by users on GitHub.

### Feature request or improvement

When a user submits a feature request or an improvement, it can be either a functional request to add or change a behavior (example: add a new Back office page) or a technical request (example: support PostgreSQL).

Functional requests are labelled "Waiting for PM" while technical requests are labelled "Waiting for dev" by the issue manager.

The Core Product team or the Core Maintainers team in charge will then analyse the request and either reject it or accept it. Rejected requests are closed with "no change required" label, while accepted requests are added to the backlog and labelled either as "to be specified" (if researches or specifications are needed) or "to do". Labels will help triaging the backlog.

### Bug report

When a user submits a bug report, the issue manager will analyse it and attempt to reproduce it. If it can be reproduced and is confirmed to be an issue, it will be labelled as "to do" and added to the backlog.

If it cannot be reproduced, the issue manager will attempt to explore the issue with the author to find out if the undesired behavior is indeed a defect in PrestaShop or a misconfiguration or specific to the author's environment.

The work of analyzing and reproducing all submitted bug reports is a very complex one, because there might be a very diverse range of reports. Moreover quite a high number of them are actually not related to the software but to how the shop is being used: the server configuration, the shop configuration, the installed modules and the chosen theme might introduce an unexpected behavior that the user mistakenly blames on a software defect.

This is why so many issues cannot be reproduced by issue managers, but figuring that out might require a long time, multiple attempts, and lots of questions.

If the issue manager is unable to reproduced the problem after multiple attempts, or if the user does not answer after 30 days, the issue is labelled as "Can't reproduce" and closed.

#### Regressions

If the bug report is confirmed, one of the key elements to evaluate is whether it is a regression. A regression is a bug that cannot be observed in the previous PrestaShop version, it means the software quality level has decreased instead of increasing. Regressions are usually milestoned to be fixed in the next patch version.

### Support request

Sometimes support requests are submitted on GitHub, ranging from questions about the software to "please help me to do X in my shop". GitHub issues are not a Q&A forum, so these requests are usually redirected to other channels using the [Support template](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new?template=3_support_question.md) and closed.

### Other

Some issues do not fit in the previous categories, such as [Releases Issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/labels/Release) which are used to follow the progress of a release, or [Epic Issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/labels/Epic) that group together all requests belonging to the same subject.

## Projects

Available in the "[Projects](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/projects)" tab of PrestaShopâ€™s GitHub repository, versions kanban boards define the scope of a minor version in terms of what the Core Maintainers and Core Product teams agree must be included before that release is out.
Both the product and the maintainers teams use it to prepare and plan the next developments and, since we deal with an open source project, the purpose of having those kanbans public is to help the community and the external mainteners to know what is at stake.

### Definition of states

A pull request should always be linked to the issue it fixes. 
That's said, there should only have "must-have" issues in the kanban and it always have an owner, be it a product manager or a developer.

"Nice to have" community issues are no longer part of the kanban. Only "must-have" issues are included in the kanban, as it must reflect the progress of the version. For example, an issue reports a must-have bug prioritized for the 1.7.8.0, the issue must appear in the 1.7.8 kanban while the linked pull request must have the 1.7.8.0 milestone.

Community contributions that fix a feature request or an improvement, must be approved by the Core product team if they bring a change in the functional behavior and by the Core developer team if they bring a change in the technical behavior. Ideally before being reviewed, at least before being merged. Here is why:

It is a bug? The specifications must be completed only when it's incomplete or when there's a behavior change.
It is a feature request or an improvement? It must be validated, prioritized, and specified. Specification can be written by a contributor or by the Core Product team. The Core Product team has the final word in whether the specification is valid or not.

A pull request that shows no activity for more than three months must be closed. If it is fixing a major bug or any topwatcher issue, it will be back in the to do column again to be completed by a developer.

Also, an important notion to keep in mind is the definition of ready. Several elements must be prepared upstream to get the issue ready to be worked on, otherwise it will not be included in the backlog.

An issue is ready when it contains:
- an explicit title and description
- validated & available specifications
- validated & available mockups
- validated & available wording
- validated & available acceptance tests

#### Not ready

**All the must-have issues that should be included in this version** but that are not yet ready - need to be assigned to an owner, be it a Product Manager or a Lead Developer.

_Who adds issues to this column?_ Mostly Core product team members once they choosed to prioritize the issue as a "must-have", but it could also be the core maintainers.

#### Backlog

**All issues that are considered _ready_** by the lead Product Manager and the lead dev. Issues in this column will be discussed with the core maintainers.

_Who adds issues to this column?_ It is the lead Product Manager with the approval of lead developers.

#### To do

**All the issues that are considered _ready_ and validated by the developers**, optionally assigned to one.

_Who adds issues to this column?_ It is the lead Product Manager with the approval of core maintainers. 

#### Blocked / Need specs

**All the issues which have been started but lack information and need to be respecified** or that are blocked by some other task.

_Who adds issues to this column?_ It is the issue owner, after the Product Manager or developer assigned to the issue has explained the blocking element. A comment must be added to explain what is blocking and what is expected.

#### In progress

**All the issues that are being actively worked on**, assigned to a developer who has claimed it.

_Who adds issues to this column?_ It is the assigned developer, once he/she starts working on it.

#### To be reviewed

**All the issues where a Pull Request has been made and is waiting for code review**

_Who adds issues to this column?_ It is the developer working on the issue.

#### To be tested

**All the issues with an approved Pull Request that is waiting for validation** by the QA team.

_Who moves issues to this column?_ It is the second maintainer who approves the Pull Request (PRs require at least two approvals), he/she must also add the "waiting for QA" label on the Pull Request.

#### To be merged

**All the issues with a Pull Request that is ready to be merged**, once approved by the QA team.

_Who moves issues to this column?_ It is the QA analyst or the core maintainers that approves the Pull Request, he/she must also add the "QA approved" label on the Pull Request.

#### Done

All the issues that are now part of the history, great work to all! 

## Pull Requests

When a contributor submits a Pull Request, it goes through multiple stages.

### Is it eligible

Core Maintainers must first validate that the Pull Request is eligible to review (the template is filled, an issue is linked to the Pull Request, the license headers are correct, the target branch is the right one ...).

If the Pull Request is not eligible, maintainers kindly ask the contributor to fix it and apply the label "Waiting for author" on the Pull Request.
If the issue associated to the Pull Request is in a project, then the issue should be moved in the "in progress" column.

### About the intent

If the Pull Request is eligible, maintainers should evaluate if the changes brought by the Pull Request are desirables.

- If the Pull Request brings in changes in design, they should ask the validation of UX designers by adding the label "Waiting for UX".
- If the Pull Request brings in changes to the product, they should ask the validation of Product managers by adding the label "Waiting for PM".
- If the Pull Request brings in changes in wording, they can should the validation of UX designers by adding the label "Waiting for wording".

If the issue associated to the Pull Request is in a project, then the issue should be moved in the "blocked / need specs" column.

If one "Waiting for ..." label has been applied, the team in charge will process the Pull Request and then add a "... approved" label. 
For example if Product team validates the new behavior implemented in a Pull Request, they will remove the "Waiting for PM" label and add the "PM approved" label instead.
If the issue associated to the Pull Request is in a project, then the issue should be moved in the "in progress" column.

There are some automated bots running on GitHub that will help maintainers to label the Pull Requests. For example Prestonbot is able to extract the new wordings and add the "Waiting for wording" label. You can read more about them [here]({{< ref "/1.7/contribute/contribution-process/how-pull-requests-are-processed.md" >}}).

### Reviewing the code

If the Pull Request is validated and there are no more "Waiting for ..." labels, then it awaits a [code review]({{< ref "/1.7/project/maintainers-guide/reviewing-pull-requests.md" >}}). The issue associated to the Pull Request is moved in the "To be reviewed" column by the developer assigned to the issue.

Maintainers provide this code review.

A maintainer can choose to
- Ask for changes in the Pull Request (which blocks merging)
- Provides comments wihout blocking or approving
- Approve the Pull Request

When the Pull Request has been approved (it needs two approvals on the Core repository), the Pull Request must be tested. It is labelled "Waiting for QA" by the second maintainer who approves the pull request.

### Testing the Pull Request

On regular Pull Requests, the QA analyst is in charge of testing the Pull Request. They will use the "How to test" part of the Pull Request description to validate the behavior implemented, and also run some more tests to validate there are no regressions.

Some technical Pull Requests however cannot be tested by QA analysts, the core developers might test them.

If the Pull Request is tested successfully, the label "QA approved" is applied and the associated issue is moved in the "to be merged" column by the person who tested it.
Otherwise, the author is notified about the issues found during the tests, the label "waiting for author" is applied and the associated issue is moved in the "in progress" column by the person who tested it.

### Merging the Pull Request

Pull Requests that have been validated by QA analyst or developer can be merged. The maintainer who merges the pull request adds the milestone of the version in which the PR will be available. If the issue associated to the Pull Request is in a project, then it must be milestoned, labelled as "fixed", closed and moved in the "done" column.
